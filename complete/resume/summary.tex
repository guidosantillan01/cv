  \cvsection{Summary}
  I am passionate about technology and its use to improve and ease human life quality. I use a multi-disciplined approach to solve problems. A fast learner who adapts quickly to assess an organizationâ€™s needs.

  As a web developer, I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node), a slight variation of the well know MERN stack. Aside from that, I am familiar with tools like: npm, eslint, prettier, Jest, Enzyme, Redux, Webpack, babel, Postman, Git, and Heroku for state management, live updates, building, version control and hosting.

  As a mechatronics engineer, I have experience in the design and improvement of automated processes, robotics, the innovation of equipment and production systems using computer-aided design to develop and test potential solutions. Proven skills in CAD/CAM/CAE, mechatronic design, PLC, embedded systems, design of machine elements, integrated manufacturing systems.
  
  My goal is to combine these technical knowledge areas into a specialized profile which can develop innovative products and solutions using multiple points of view among various tech fields. I am actively looking forward to expanding my knowledge, improve my skills and obtain relevant experience in the IT industry in order to help develop world-changing solutions.
